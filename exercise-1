1. Newton Second Law

algorithm

input mass of car which is 600 kg
input acceleration being applied to mass which is 2 m/s2
calculate resultant force

pseudocode

SET m = 600
SET a = 2
SET F = m * a 
display (F)

2. Tahun Kabisat

algorithm

input a year
check to see if year is evenly divisible by 4
if its not, then its not leap year
if yes, check if its evenly divisible by 100
if its not, then its leap year
if yes, check if its evenly divisible by 400
if yes, its a leap year
if not then its not a leap year

pseudocode

SET year = random

IF year/4 has remainder THEN
	display(normal year)
ELSE
	IF year/100 has remainder THEN
		display (leap year)
	ELSE 
		IF year/400 has remainder THEN
			display (normal year)
		ELSE
			display (leap year)
		ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDIF



3. Laundry Day
alogrithm
Decide amount of clothes to be washed
Starting from scracth, put in one piece of clothing to the washer and count it
repeat the line above until the count is the same as the amount of clothes to be washed
start laundry

pseudocode
SET clothes=20
SET count = 0
WHILE count<clothes
	SET count = count + 1
ENDWHILE
START Laundry


4. Periksa Kuku
algorithm
From 40 students, pick one student and check their nails
If student has long nail, give them punishment
If studen has short nail, compliment them
Repeat the process until all 40 students have been checked

pseudocode

SET studentnochecked = 40

WHILE studentnotchecked > 0
	pick one student
	IF studentnail = long
		display (punishment)
	ELSE
		display (compliment)
	END IF
	SET studentnotchecked = studentnotchecked - 1
ENDWHILE
