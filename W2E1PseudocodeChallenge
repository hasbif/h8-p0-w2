1. Newton Second Law

algorithm

input mass of car which is 600 kg
input acceleration being applied to mass which is 2 m/s2
calculate resultant force

pseudocode

SET m = 600
SET a = 2
SET F = m * a 
display (F)

2. Tahun Kabisat

algorithm

input a year
check to see if year is evenly divisible by 4
if its not, then its not leap year
if yes, check if its evenly divisible by 100
if its not, then its leap year
if yes, check if its evenly divisible by 400
if yes, its a leap year
if not then its not a leap year

pseudocode

SET year = random

IF year/4 has remainder THEN
	display(normal year)
ELSE
	IF year/100 has remainder THEN
		display (leap year)
	ELSE 
		IF year/400 has remainder THEN
			display (normal year)
		ELSE
			display (leap year)
		ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDIF
